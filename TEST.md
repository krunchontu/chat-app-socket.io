# Unit Test Documentation Overview

## 1. Message Service Test (`server/service/messageService.test.js`)

### Overview
This file contains extensive test cases for message operations, including message creation, editing, deletion, and retrieval.

### Test Structure
- **Test Suites**:
  - `createMessage`
  - `editMessage`
  - `deleteMessage`
  - `getMessage`

### Mocking Strategy
- Uses Jest mocks for dependencies like database models and utility functions.

### Test Coverage
- Covers:
  - Happy paths
  - Error handling
  - Edge cases

### Specific Tests
- Tests for:
  - Message creation
  - Message editing
  - Message deletion
  - Message retrieval

### Validation Cases
- Handles cases like:
  - Empty messages
  - Unauthorized edits

### Key Test Cases
- Creating new messages successfully
- Handling errors when users are not found
- Editing messages (with appropriate ownership verification)
- Deleting messages (with permission checks)
- Retrieving messages with pagination

## 2. Socket Authentication Test (`server/middleware/socketAuth.test.js`)

### Overview
This file tests the Socket.IO authentication middleware.

### Test Coverage
- Covers:
  - Authentication flow
  - Authorization
  - Token validation
  - Error handling

### Specific Test Cases
- Authenticating sockets with valid tokens in the auth object
- Authenticating sockets with valid tokens in headers
- Disconnecting sockets with invalid tokens
- Handling cases where users are not found
- Handling cases where no authentication is provided

## 3. User Controller Test (`server/controller/userController.test.js`)

### Overview
This file tests user management operations, including login, registration, and profile management.

### Test Coverage
- Covers:
  - Authentication
  - Registration
  - Profile management
  - Input validation
  - Error handling

### Mocking Strategy
- Demonstrates how to mock Express request/response objects.

### Key Test Cases
- Registering new users successfully
- Handling duplicate username attempts
- User login with valid and invalid credentials
- Retrieving user profiles for authenticated users
- Handling validation errors for missing fields

## Running the Tests

### Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Fulfills Requirements
- Provides at least three comprehensive unit test files
- Tests critical functionality across different system components
- Ensures test failures when issues are detected (no fallback mechanism)
- Supports CI/CD pipeline requirements (failed tests block deployment)
