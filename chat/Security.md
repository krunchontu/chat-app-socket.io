# Security Guidelines and Implementations

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Dialoque chat application and provides guidelines for maintaining security in future development.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Content Sanitization

All user-generated content is sanitized using DOMPurify before being displayed to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

```jsx
// Example implementation in MessageList.jsx
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

// In the message rendering:
<span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(message.text) }} />
```

### 2. Enhanced Password Requirements

User passwords must meet the following criteria:
- At least 8 characters long
- Contain at least one uppercase letter
- Contain at least one lowercase letter
- Contain at least one number
- Contain at least one special character

A password strength indicator provides visual feedback to users during registration.

### 3. CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery protection has been implemented using token-based verification:

- A CSRF token is generated by the server and stored client-side
- The token is included in all non-GET requests
- Tokens are validated on the server for all state-changing operations
- Token rotation is supported with each response

## Security Best Practices for Development

### Authentication and Authorization

1. **JWT Security**:
   - Keep JWT secrets secure in environment variables
   - Set appropriate expiration times for tokens
   - Use secure and HTTP-only cookies when possible

2. **Authentication Flows**:
   - Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
   - Use email verification for new accounts
   - Implement two-factor authentication for sensitive operations

### Data Protection

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all input on both client and server
   - Use strict schema validation for API requests
   - Sanitize all user-generated content before display

2. **Sensitive Data**:
   - Minimize storage of sensitive data
   - Never log passwords or security tokens
   - Use HTTPS for all communications

### API Security

1. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Add Retry-After headers for rate-limited responses
   - Log unusual API activity patterns

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Use generic error messages in production
   - Don't expose system details in error responses
   - Log detailed errors server-side

### Code Security

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use security scanning tools (npm audit)
   - Be cautious with third-party libraries

2. **Code Reviews**:
   - Conduct security-focused code reviews
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Follow least privilege principle

## Security Testing

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Include security cases in unit and integration tests
   - Test input validation and error handling

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Conduct regular security audits
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Perform penetration testing before major releases

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) rather than using the public issue tracker.
