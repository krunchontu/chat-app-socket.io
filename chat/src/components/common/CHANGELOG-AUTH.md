# Authentication System Refactoring Changelog

## Version 2.0.0 (2025-05-03)

### Major Architectural Changes

- **Complete Restructuring**: Transformed monolithic AuthContext into a layered architecture with proper separation of concerns
- **New Services**: Created dedicated services for authentication, storage, and API operations
- **New Utilities**: Added specialized utilities for JWT handling and URL construction

### New Files Created

- `utils/urlUtils.js` - URL construction and API endpoint generation
- `utils/jwtUtils.js` - JWT token parsing, validation, and management
- `services/storageService.js` - Abstraction over localStorage with error handling
- `services/apiService.js` - Centralized API requests with retry capability
- `services/authService.js` - Authentication business logic and flow control
- `components/common/README-auth.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `components/common/CHANGELOG-AUTH.md` - This changelog

### AuthContext.jsx Changes

- **State Management**: Replaced multiple useState calls with useReducer for predictable state transitions
- **Error Handling**: Added explicit error state and handling
- **API Integration**: Delegated API calls to authService instead of direct axios usage
- **Storage**: Removed direct localStorage access in favor of storageService
- **Token Handling**: Removed JWT token logic in favor of jwtUtils
- **Lifecycle**: Improved initialization and cleanup of resources
- **Accessibility**: Exposed loading and error states to consumers

### Technical Improvements

- **Code Duplication**: Eliminated repeated URL construction logic across methods
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling and logging
- **Security**: Better token validation and CSRF protection
- **Performance**: Reduced redundant operations and optimized state updates
- **Testing**: Improved testability through isolation of concerns
- **Readability**: Better code organization and documentation

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Loading States**: More consistent loading indicator handling
- **Error Feedback**: Better error message exposure to UI components
- **Session Management**: Improved handling of expired sessions

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed potential memory leak in token validation interval
- Fixed incomplete logout when server request fails
- Improved error handling during failed initialization
- Fixed inconsistent state after failed authentication operations

## Migration Guide

If you're directly using AuthContext in your components, the API surface remains mostly unchanged:

```jsx
// Before and after
const { user, loading, login, register, logout, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
```

The main difference is that error handling is now available through the context:

```jsx
// New error state
const { error } = useAuth();

// Use in your component
if (error) {
  return <ErrorDisplay message={error} />;
}
```

See the README-auth.md file for complete documentation and usage examples.
